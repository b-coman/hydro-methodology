# Contributing to hydro Methodology

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the hydro methodology! As an open-source project under CC BY 4.0, we welcome contributions that help evolve and improve the methodology.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Documentation Improvements

The most valuable contributions often come from practitioners using hydro in real projects:

- **Clarifications**: If something isn't clear, help us improve it
- **Examples**: Share real-world scenarios and solutions
- **Corrections**: Fix typos, broken links, or technical errors

### 2. Methodology Extensions

As teams adopt hydro in different contexts, new patterns emerge:

- **Industry adaptations**: How hydro works in fintech, healthcare, etc.
- **Scale variations**: Insights from small teams vs enterprise
- **Tool integrations**: How hydro works with specific platforms

### 3. Case Studies

Nothing validates methodology like real results:

- **Success stories**: Share outcomes. Good, or bad. Bad is good too :)
- **Challenges overcome**: What didn't work, and how you adapted to your context
- **Lessons learned**: What would you do differently

## Contribution Process

### For Small Changes (typos, clarifications)

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b improve-dependencies-page`)
3. Make your changes
4. Commit with clear message (`git commit -m "Clarify dependency cascade example"`)
5. Push to your fork (`git push origin improve-dependencies-page`)
6. Open a Pull Request with description of changes

### For Significant Additions

1. Open an issue first to discuss the proposed addition
2. Wait for community feedback and alignment
3. Follow the small changes process above

## What Makes a Good Contribution

✓ **Practical over theoretical**: Real examples beat abstract concepts
✓ **Clear and concise**: Follow the existing writing style
✓ **Evidence-based**: Include metrics or outcomes when possible
✓ **Methodology-aligned**: Contributions should reinforce core hydro principles

## What We're Looking For

- Real-world implementation examples
- Metrics and measurements from hydro adoption
- Integration patterns with existing tools
- Common pitfalls and solutions
- Industry-specific adaptations

## Code of Conduct

- Be respectful and constructive
- Focus on improving the methodology
- Share knowledge openly
- Credit others' contributions
