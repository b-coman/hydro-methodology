# hydro Introduction

Hydro (Hybrid Development Resource Orchestration) is a **framework for managing software development in hybrid environments**, where engineers work alongside AI coding assistants to ship production-grade features.

***

### The Evolution We're Living

Product and software development is experiencing its biggest shift since the move from waterfall to agile. AI assistants can generate entire features in hours, but they still need a high-level of guidance, context, and validation to produce quality results.

The new reality:

* **Code generation speed -** from days to hours
* **Focus shift -** decision-making and validation, not dev velocity
* **Context management** - AI needs continuous context to stay on track
* **Quality control** - humans focus on architecture, business logic, and validation

### How hydro Works

hydro is aimed to solve the three core gaps that traditional frameworks don't address: **time compression**, **context fragmentation** and **direction ambiguity** . So we designed hydro specifically to bridge these gaps.

Core Principles:

* **Waves replace time-boxes** → work flows when dependencies clear, not when calendars dictate
* **AI handles generic code** → code generation, testing, documentation, refactoring
* **Humans make decisions** → architecture, business logic, validation, strategy
* **Rolling context** → maintain continuous understanding across tasks and waves
* **Measure capabilities** → track what becomes possible, not just what gets done



We propose a paradigm shift. From _"What can our team build in 2 weeks?" &#x74;_&#x6F; _"What decision should we make next?"._&#x20;

The real capacity limit isn't on dev teams anymore. It's on decision makers.

### Built for Real Teams

Hydro isn't theoretical, it's based on real work and patterns we've seen work in teams already using AI assistants. We're sharing what worked and making it repeatable.

**What you'll be learning:**

* How to structure work for optimal human-AI collaboration
* Ways to maintain context and quality at AI speed
* Patterns for managing dependencies in hybrid environments
* Methods for validating AI output to maintain velocity
