# hydro Introduction

hydro (Hybrid Development Resource Orchestration) is a methodology for managing software development in hybrid environments, where human engineers work with AI coding assistants to deliver complex features.

Unlike Scrum, Kanban or other more or less popular Agile Frameworks, hydro focuses on unlocking tomorrow's development based on today's achievements. Its forward looking approach considers the increase pace in writing code and the shift of the capacity limit from engineering to decision making.

Software development has changed. But we still operate with the mindset of steam-powered machines when electricity has just emerged.

:exclamation:AI is the new electricity.

So let's electrify! :zap:

### 2025 State of The Nation

* **Vibe coding sucks** - There's no "vibe coding" for real software development
* **Agile doesn't fit -** it's like burning horses as fuel just because horses are a mental model for power. What actually means a two-weeks Sprint when an entire migration can be written in a few hours?
* **Story points estimations?** - Give a break, they were always a substitute for time. And complexity, what means now complexity from AI perspective?
* **Time-based planning?** We knew all along that dependencies are the real constraint, not time.

Let's look at how the Sprint concept looks like by its definition in Scrum:

Per Scrum Book, we have the following two elements in a software development project management:

* Iteration aka Sprints - usually two weeks for most of teams
* Sprint Goal - usually understood as scope, or as value delivered to the user in one Sprint

Ideally a Sprint goal is achieved within a Sprint - otherwise the entire concept of fast iterating and course correction lose its sense.

In reality, many times Sprints are nothing more than an arbitrary time frame that nobody cares about. The goal achievements and scope delivery looks like in the image below. Creep, spillovers and stories that are replicate across multiple Sprints.

In AI world the things started to be worse, especially with the new "vibe" of "vibe coding". AI assistant does things super fast but ironically they never end. Refactoring, multiple versions, architecture breaks and bugs all over the place - AI is like an young and powerful stallion without a rider.

For an AI coding hybrid environment the real constrains are context windows, dependencies and architecture decisions. Not time and not complexity.

### The ido4 Way

We propose a paradigm shift.

From _"What can our team build in 2 weeks?" &#x74;_&#x6F; _"What decision should we make next?"_

The real capacity limit isn't on dev teams anymore. It's on decision makers.

***

### How it works

**Rolling context**\
→ Keep continuous context to overcome AI assistant limitations

**Waves replace Sprints**\
→ Work flows when dependencies clear, not when calendars say

**AI does what AI does best**\
→ Pattern implementation, test generation, boilerplate code

**Humans do what humans do best**\
→ Architecture, decisions, validation, strategy

**Measure possibilities, not time**\
→ Track capabilities unlocked, not story points burned

***

### What We're Exploring

This is our attempt to formalize what some teams have already discovered: **development with AI assistants requires different thinking.** We're documenting patterns that work and sharing them.
