# hydro & POM

Product Operating Models (POM) provides strategic framework for creating customer value.&#x20;

hydro provides the execution methodology for the AI era.&#x20;

Together, they create a powerful mix: a world where Product Managers can test ideas at the speed of their thoughts, and engineers become true product partners rather than ticket-takers.

This is Product Operation Model augmented by AI.&#x20;

***

## Why POM + hydro

Product Operating Models emphasizes outcomes, continuous discovery, and empowered teams. hydro doesn't change these principles.&#x20;

**Continuous Discovery -** Test 10 ideas in the time it used to take to test one. PMs can validate hypotheses with working prototypes in hours, not weeks.

**Customer-Centric Decisions -** Engineers participate in customer conversations because they're freed from implementation details to understand the "why" behind the "what."

**Empowered Product Teams -** Teams ship when ready, not when sprints end. True empowerment means controlling your own delivery cadence.

**Data-Informed Iteration -** Get real usage data faster because features done in days. Learn and adapt at market speed.

The convergence is natural: When implementation is no longer the bottleneck, product people and engineers naturally focus on the same thing - understanding and solving customer problems.

## The Product Management evolution challenge

The prescriptive product development frameworks we've been following for years are hitting a wall. Not because agility itself is flawed, but because the commercialized version of "Agile" has lost its way. **And AI is accelerating this collapse.**

When a product team can build a fully working MVP in a week instead of a quarter, that's more incremental improvement - that's a paradigm shift. **Code is outrunning decision.** The assembly line now operates at 10x speed, but can the decision-making processes keep up?

We've been treating software development like factory work for too long, optimizing for resource utilization rather than outcome achievement. Now we have exactly what we wished for - an assembly line that operates on fast-forward. But when your production line moves 10x faster, can your supply chain keep up?

### **The Five Levels of Product Maturity**

There are five maturity levels in what we call Product Maturity. They are defined in regards of what the organization is able to do today, and by using that we can predict what would be able to do tomorrow.

**Initial** → "We're winging it"

* Teams operate without clear processes or product strategy
* Ad-hoc decision making based on immediate pressures
* No systematic approach to customer value delivery

**Repeatable** → "We've got some structure, but it's inconsistent"

* Basic processes exist but aren't standardized across teams
* Project-driven thinking dominates over product outcomes
* Coordination happens through meetings and handoffs

**Defined** → "We have a solid system in place"

* Clear and standardized approach to product development
* Process clarity but limited adaptability to changing conditions
* **Most organizations plateau here - and this is where AI creates opportunity**

**Managed** → "Our processes align with goals, and we track progress"

* Teams work with shared focus on customer outcomes
* Data-informed decision making with clear success metrics
* **Target state for effective Hydro adoption**

**Optimizing** → "We're continuously improving across the board"

* Active pursuit of innovation and refinement in every aspect
* Adaptive methodology that evolves with capabilities and market needs
* **What becomes possible with AI-augmented product development**

Organizations with solid product fundamentals (Defined level+) can leverage hydro to leap toward Optimizing maturity. But teams still "winging it" or stuck in pure process mode will find AI's speed overwhelming rather than empowering.

Think this way: if you can't ride a bicycle, a motorcycle won't help you at all. But if you're already cycling well, that motorcycle becomes a superpower.

**hydro Sweet Spot:** teams that have basic product discipline but feel constrained by time-boxed processes. They're ready to let dependency-driven flow and AI partnership accelerate their natural product instincts.
{% endhint %}

### The Ownership dilemma

But the fundamental challenge was never pure technical - it always have been organizational → **Ownership doesn't stand alone. It's built on trust. Accountability doesn't stand alone. It's built on ownership.**

**The broken pattern is that** organizations demand accountability without granting real authority. Teams are held responsible for outcomes they can't control. This creates a culture where:

* Decisions are made by those who don't execute the work
* Execution happens without understanding the business context
* Quality suffers because ownership is distributed across handoffs

AI doesn't replace human judgment, it amplifies the judgment of those closest to the work. When engineers can implement solutions as fast as they can understand problems, the natural collaboration between product thinking and technical execution becomes more than "just" possible. It becomes unavoidable.

**The hydro difference:** dependencies, not departments, drive the work.

## Hydro as Practical Implementation for POM

Hydro isn't a framework imposed from above. It's the natural methodology that emerges when AI-capable teams focus on delivering customer value efficiently.

**Key Insight**: When AI can implement solutions as fast as humans can define them, traditional time-boxed planning becomes an artificial constraint. Work naturally organizes around **dependency completion** rather than **calendar boundaries**.

### Wave-Based Execution: POM Components in Practice

The beauty of [wave](../methodology/core-concepts/waves.md) concept in hydro is how they naturally marry product thinking with execution. Unlike traditional phases that separate "discovery" from "delivery," waves blend them into a unified flow where learning and building happen simultaneously.

But the revolutionary aspect isn't just the 2-5 day timeframes. It's how waves naturally bind epics to execution. In traditional models, epics float in backlogs, gradually decomposing into tasks that scatter across sprints.&#x20;

In hydro, an epic enters a wave and emerges as working software in matters of days. The same people who shaped the customer problem own its solution through to production.

This changes everything about product work. Discovery doesn't precede development, it happens through development. When you can test three payment approaches with real users in a week, the line between "figuring out what to build" and "building it" disappears. Product Managers no longer write detailed specs and wait; they collaborate with engineers to explore possibilities through working code.

### AI-Human Collaboration

According to our observations, most of the code (40-60%) can be written autonomously by AI **if** humans clearly define intent. PMs specify what customers need, Lead Engineer provides the architecture patterns, AI delivers working solutions, humans test and validate the business value. This frees product minds for strategic thinking while maintaining quality through AI's consistency.

Another 30-40% benefits from AI assistance—complex business logic where human domain knowledge guides AI's implementation speed. The remaining work requires human wisdom for architectural decisions and strategic pivots, with AI providing research and analysis support.

For detailed task classification patterns, see ../methodology/core-concepts/tasks.md.

### **Real Example - Payment Feature Discovery**:

_Traditional Approach_:

* PM researches payment options for 2 weeks
* Writes detailed PRD with mockups
* Engineers estimate 6 weeks to build
* 3 months later: discover customers wanted something different

_POM + hydro Approach_:

* Monday: PM and engineer discuss customer payment friction
* Tuesday: AI implements 3 different payment flows based on their collaborative design
* Wednesday: Deploy all 3 as A/B/C test to subset of users
* Thursday: Data shows clear winner, unexpected insight emerges
* Friday: Ship winning version with refinements based on user behavior

The PM is empowered with rapid validation. The engineer is engaged with customer impact. Both own the outcome together.

## The "AIgility" Future: What Becomes Possible

### The Fundamental Shift

AI it's not about doing the same things faster, it's about doing things better. This is what many orgs miss. When implementation takes hours instead of months, the entire game changes. The constraint moves from "can we build it?" to "should we build it?" The bottleneck shifts from execution to decision-making.&#x20;

In the new world, the competitive advantage will from who can take better decisions, not from who can code fastest (because everyone will code very fast). This is where traditional organizations struggle → they try to use AI like a faster typewriter, when it's actually a different way of thinking.

### The New Reality

As a consequence, in more mature AI-augmented organizations, something beautiful happens: product people become technical, and technical people become product-minded. Not because of training programs or process changes, but because the artificial barriers that kept them apart dissolve.

When a PM can test three solutions in an afternoon, they start thinking like engineers. When engineers can implement ideas as fast as they conceive them, they start thinking like product managers. The result? Hybrid professionals who understand both customer problems and technical possibilities.

{% hint style="info" %}
**The hydro truth**: the future isn't about managing AI. It's about creating environments where human creativity and AI capability combine naturally. When that happens, you don't need to impose methodology. The right way of working emerges like water finding its level.
{% endhint %}

## Conclusion: The Path Forward

POM provides the strategic framework. hydro provides the execution methodology. AI provides the capability.&#x20;

Together, they create a new reality where product teams deliver value at the speed of thought.

The organizations that thrive won't be those who implement the most sophisticated processes. They'll be those who create environments where product thinking and engineering expertise naturally converge, where customer problems get solved through rapid experimentation, where teams own outcomes from conception to production.

The choice is simple: Embrace the natural evolution of product development in the AI era, or watch competitors who do leave you behind.
