# hydro vs Scrum

## Understanding the Context

Scrum has served software teams brilliantly for over two decades. It brought flexibility, collaboration, and customer focus to an industry dominated by rigid planning. The principles of Scrum—iterative development, continuous feedback, and team empowerment—remain as valuable today as they were in 2001.

What's changed isn't Scrum's principles, but the fundamental constraints of software development. When Scrum was created, every line of code was written by a human. Today, AI assistants can implement entire features while we sleep. This shift doesn't invalidate Scrum—it invites us to evolve it.

hydro is that evolution. It keeps what works in Scrum while adapting to a world where AI is a full development partner.

## What Stays the Same

The good news is that most of Scrum's core values translate directly to hydro:

| Principle                  | Scrum                               | hydro                                 |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Iterative Development**  | Deliver working software in sprints | Deliver working software in waves     |
| **Customer Collaboration** | Regular demos and feedback          | Continuous deployment and feedback    |
| **Team Empowerment**       | Self-organizing teams               | Self-directing teams with AI partners |
| **Transparency**           | Sprint boards and burndowns         | Real-time dependency visualization    |
| **Continuous Improvement** | Retrospectives                      | Built-in pattern learning             |
| **Working Software**       | Definition of done                  | Automated quality gates               |

The philosophy remains identical: deliver value incrementally, adapt based on learning, and empower teams to find the best way to work.

## What Evolves

The main evolution is how we organize and measure work:

| Aspect                | Scrum                     | hydro                             | Why It Changes                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Planning Unit**     | Fixed sprints (1-4 weeks) | Flexible waves (2 hours - 5 days) | AI doesn't need synchronized schedules           |
| **Planning Focus**    | "What fits in 2 weeks?"   | "What should we build next?"      | Implementation speed is no longer the constraint |
| **Estimation**        | Story points              | Dependency mapping                | AI makes timing predictable                      |
| **Daily Sync**        | Standup meetings          | Async updates + decision queues   | AI works 24/7, humans don't                      |
| **Progress Tracking** | Velocity (points/sprint)  | Unlock rate (capabilities/time)   | Value matters more than effort                   |
| **Team Composition**  | Humans only               | Humans + AI partners              | New team member with unique capabilities         |

## The Mindset Shift

The biggest change isn't in the process—it's in how we think about development:

### From Time Management to Decision Management

In Scrum, we manage time because human capacity is finite. We ask "What can we fit into this sprint?"

In hydro, we manage decisions because AI capacity is virtually unlimited. We ask "What should we build next?"

### From Estimation to Architecture

In Scrum, we estimate because we need to know if work fits in a sprint.

In hydro, we map dependencies because we need to know what unlocks what.

### From Synchronous to Asynchronous

In Scrum, we synchronize through ceremonies because humans work simultaneously.

In hydro, we coordinate through dependencies because AI works continuously.

## A Practical Comparison

Let's see how a typical feature development looks in both approaches:

### Building a User Authentication System

**In Scrum:**

1. Story estimation in planning (2 hours)
2. Sprint 1: Design and interfaces (2 weeks)
3. Sprint 2: Implementation (2 weeks)
4. Sprint 3: Testing and polish (2 weeks)
5. Daily standups throughout (15 min × 30 days)

**In hydro:**

1. Dependency mapping (30 minutes)
2. Foundation Wave: Interfaces and schemas (Day 1, mostly AI)
3. Feature Wave: Implementation (Day 2-3, AI with human review)
4. Integration Wave: Testing and deployment (Day 4, automated)
5. Async decision handling throughout

Both deliver the same feature. Both maintain quality. Both involve the whole team. The difference is that hydro acknowledges AI can implement faster than humans can plan sprints.

## Making the Transition

The beautiful thing about moving from Scrum to hydro is that you're not abandoning anything—you're evolving it:

### Week 1: Keep Your Sprints, Add Waves

* Continue your normal sprint planning
* Identify which stories could be "waves" within the sprint
* Let AI handle the implementation of clear, well-defined tasks
* Use saved time for better architecture and review

### Week 2-3: Shift Your Metrics

* Still track velocity, but also track unlock rate
* Notice which tasks enable others
* Start thinking in dependencies, not just stories
* Celebrate capabilities delivered, not just points completed

### Week 4: Adjust Your Ceremonies

* Make standups async-first (AI doesn't need to attend)
* Focus planning on architecture and dependencies
* Turn estimation into dependency mapping
* Use retrospectives to identify patterns for AI

### Month 2: Embrace the Flow

* Let waves complete when ready, not when sprints end
* Allow AI to work overnight on clear tasks
* Focus human time on decisions and design
* Watch your delivery accelerate naturally

## Common Questions

**"Do we abandon Scrum completely?"** Not at all. hydro is Scrum evolved for AI collaboration. The values remain, the implementation adapts.

**"What about our existing tools?"** Most Scrum tools work fine. You're tracking waves instead of sprints, dependencies instead of stories. The boards look similar, the flow is faster.

**"How do we handle compliance/regulations?"** The same way you do now, but more efficiently. Compliance gates become part of wave definitions. Reviews happen continuously instead of at sprint boundaries.

**"What if our organization requires Scrum?"** Perfect! Run hydro inside Scrum. Your sprints become containers for multiple waves. You still report in sprints while working in waves.

## The Path Forward

hydro isn't a rejection of Scrum—it's its natural evolution. Just as Scrum evolved from Waterfall by acknowledging that requirements change, hydro evolves from Scrum by acknowledging that AI changes development speed.

The teams already using hydro report the same satisfaction they felt when first adopting Scrum: the joy of working with the grain of reality instead of against it. They're not working harder; they're working smarter with their new AI partner.

The transition is gentler than you might think. Start with one team, one sprint, one wave. Let success guide adoption. Most teams find that once they experience the flow of hydro, they never want to go back to rigid sprints.
