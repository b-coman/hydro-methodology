# Getting Started

### <mark style="color:red;">NOT YET DONE. PLEASE IGNORE</mark>

### Getting Started: Implementation Resources

For teams and organizations interested in experimenting with Hydro methodology:

#### Assessment and Planning

**Readiness Evaluation**:

* Team experience with AI development tools and practices
* Current pain points with traditional sprint-based development
* Organizational openness to methodology experimentation
* Technical infrastructure supporting continuous integration and deployment

**Pilot Program Design**:

* Recommended starting scope: Single team, 4-6 week pilot project
* Success criteria definition and measurement approaches
* Risk mitigation strategies and rollback plans
* Stakeholder communication and expectation management

#### Quick Start Checklist

**Week 1: Foundation Setup**

* [ ] Identify pilot team (3-5 people, including product manager)
* [ ] Select low-risk project with clear dependencies (4-6 weeks scope)
* [ ] Assess current AI tool access (GitHub Copilot, Claude, ChatGPT)
* [ ] Document current development pain points and baseline metrics
* [ ] Schedule initial team training session (4 hours)

**Week 2: First Wave Planning**

* [ ] Map project dependencies using Hydro principles
* [ ] Classify initial tasks using four-tier framework
* [ ] Set up basic wave tracking (can start with simple spreadsheet)
* [ ] Define wave completion criteria and quality gates
* [ ] Plan first foundation wave (aim for 1-2 days duration)

**Week 3-4: Execute First Wave**

* [ ] Implement AI-ready tasks with context packages
* [ ] Practice human-AI collaboration on AI-assisted tasks
* [ ] Track daily progress and decision latency
* [ ] Document lessons learned and classification adjustments
* [ ] Measure wave completion against criteria

**Week 5-6: Evaluate and Iterate**

* [ ] Calculate PER (Possibility Expansion Rate) for completed waves
* [ ] Compare velocity and quality against baseline
* [ ] Adjust task classification based on actual results
* [ ] Plan next wave or project expansion
* [ ] Present findings to stakeholders with ROI analysis

#### Framework and Tools

**Methodology Resources**:

* Wave planning templates and dependency mapping worksheets
* Task classification guidelines and decision frameworks
* Quality gate checklists and validation criteria
* AI context package templates and examples

**Implementation Support**:

* Team training materials and workshop formats
* Coaching guidance for methodology adoption
* Best practice sharing and case study analysis
* Community forums for practitioners and researchers

#### Common Implementation Challenges and Solutions

**Challenge: "AI tools aren't working as expected"**

* **Solution**: Start with conservative task classification, focus on clear context packages
* **Timeline**: Expect 2-3 weeks for AI collaboration patterns to stabilize

**Challenge: "Team resisting change from sprint structure"**

* **Solution**: Begin with "hybrid sprints" - wave planning within sprint boundaries
* **Timeline**: Gradual transition over 4-6 weeks to full wave-based flow

**Challenge: "Stakeholders want traditional sprint reports"**

* **Solution**: Create wave progress dashboards that map to familiar sprint metrics
* **Timeline**: Parallel reporting during 8-week transition period

**Challenge: "Dependencies more complex than anticipated"**

* **Solution**: Start with simpler dependency chains, build complexity gradually
* **Timeline**: Focus on linear dependencies first 2-4 weeks, then add parallel streams

**Challenge: "Quality concerns with AI-generated code"**

* **Solution**: Implement rigorous human review gates, start with AI-ready tasks only
* **Timeline**: Expand AI task scope as team confidence and patterns improve

**Measurement and Improvement**:

* Metrics collection templates and dashboard examples
* Retrospective formats optimized for wave-based development
* Continuous improvement frameworks and feedback loops
* Research participation opportunities and data contribution



### Research Questions and Community Validation

This methodology represents ongoing research into optimal human-AI collaboration patterns in enterprise software development. We're exploring several critical questions:

#### Technical Research Areas

**AI Collaboration Optimization**:

* How do different AI capabilities (coding, testing, documentation) affect optimal task classification in enterprise environments?
* What patterns emerge in successful human-AI pair programming for complex business logic?
* How can we measure and improve the effectiveness of AI context packages across different domains?

**Dependency and Flow Management**:

* What dependency patterns maximize flow efficiency in large enterprise codebases with complex integration requirements?
* How do regulatory and compliance requirements affect wave design and completion criteria?
* What techniques best handle evolving requirements within dependency-driven planning?

**Quality and Governance**:

* What quality gates are most effective for AI-generated code in enterprise environments with strict security and compliance requirements?
* How can we balance AI automation with human skill development and career progression?
* What governance frameworks best support AI-assisted development while maintaining enterprise risk management?

#### Organizational Research Areas

**Team Dynamics and Structure**:

* What team compositions and sizes optimize for integrated product-engineering collaboration?
* How do enterprise hierarchies and approval processes integrate with possibility-driven development?
* What organizational changes are required to support continuous flow rather than time-boxed iterations?

**Scaling and Adoption**:

* How does the methodology scale across multiple teams working on interconnected products?
* What change management approaches are most effective for transforming from traditional Scrum to Hydro?
* How do we handle the transition period where some teams use Hydro while others remain on traditional methodologies?

**Business Alignment**:

* How do possibility-driven metrics align with traditional business planning and budget cycles?
* What reporting and communication patterns best serve stakeholders accustomed to sprint-based updates?
* How do we demonstrate ROI and business value during the methodology transition period?
