# Getting Started

Ready to try hydro with your team? Here's a simple path that works.

## Step 1: Pick Your Pilot (Week 1)

Choose a small team (2-4 people) with AI tool access. Select a 2-3 week project that won't break anything if it goes sideways. Make sure someone can make decisions without 5 approval layers.

The goal isn't perfection—it's learning. Pick something real but not mission-critical.

## Step 2: Map Your First Wave (Week 1-2)

List what needs to be built. Identify what blocks what (dependencies). Classify your tasks:

* Can AI handle this with clear instructions?
* Does it need human guidance and validation?
* Is it too complex/critical for AI assistance?

Plan your first wave: 1-3 days of work that delivers something you can actually use.

_For detailed task classification, see_ [_Tasks_](../methodology/core-concepts/tasks.md)

## Step 3: Run the Wave (Week 2-3)

Let AI handle the clear-cut implementation tasks. Human reviews and validates everything before it ships. Work progresses when dependencies clear, not when calendars dictate.

Ship when it's genuinely done—quality gates passed, integration verified, business value delivered.

_For wave execution details, see_ [_Waves_](../methodology/core-concepts/waves.md)

## Step 4: Measure and Decide (Week 3-4)

Ask the important questions:

* Did you ship faster than usual?
* Was the quality as good or better?
* Did the team enjoy the process more?
* Do you want to keep going?

One wave will teach you more about hydro than reading all the documentation.

## When You Need Help

Most teams hit questions around:

* Dependency mapping for complex projects
* AI task classification for your specific domain
* Stakeholder communication about the methodology change
* Scaling beyond the pilot team to multiple waves

**A note on tooling**: As you scale hydro, you'll likely find that traditional project management tools weren't designed for AI teammates. Your AI assistant can write code but can't update Jira tickets or manage dependencies autonomously. For long-term success, AI needs the ability to manipulate work items alongside human developers—just like it manipulates code.

We've seen these challenges before. When you get stuck, reach out.

## What You'll Learn

This isn't about perfect implementation—it's about finding your direction. The methodology provides the framework. Your team discovers the specifics that work in your environment.

The tools are ready. The approach is proven. The only question is: when do you start?
