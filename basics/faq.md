# FAQ

<details>

<summary>Does this replace Agile?</summary>

It evolves Agile for the AI era. Core values remain, but practices adapt—dependency-driven waves instead of sprints, possibility expansion instead of story points.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How is this different from just adding AI tools to Agile?</summary>

Most approaches add AI as assistants to existing processes. HASDM redesigns the entire workflow around AI capabilities, optimizing planning and execution patterns for AI-human collaboration.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What AI tools do we need?</summary>

The methodology is tool-agnostic. Most teams use code-capable AI assistants like GitHub Copilot, Claude, or similar tools that can generate working code from specifications.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How long does adoption take?</summary>

Teams see initial results in 2-3 weeks and significant improvements by month 2. Full proficiency typically takes 2-3 months.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Is this only for greenfield projects?</summary>

No. It works for new development, maintenance, and modernization projects. Any project with clear technical requirements and dependencies can benefit.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can we start with a smaller pilot?</summary>

Yes. Many teams start with 2-3 developers on a low-risk project. The methodology works at any scale and starting small allows validation before broader adoption.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What happens when AI makes mistakes?</summary>

The methodology includes human validation based on task classification. AI-generated code goes through standard review processes, often with better test coverage than traditional development.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do we measure success with this methodology?</summary>

Track Possibility Expansion Rate (tasks unlocked per task completed), wave completion efficiency, and capabilities delivered. Quality metrics typically improve due to comprehensive automated testing.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What if our team resists changing from familiar processes?</summary>

Start with a pilot project to demonstrate benefits. Most developers appreciate focusing on architecture over implementation. Show results rather than requiring belief upfront.
