# No Brainer

## The Current State of Development

Something interesting is happening in software development. AI coding assistants have reached a level of capability where they can reliably generate working code, comprehensive tests, and documentation. Yet development processes remain largely unchanged from the pre-AI era.

**Current process patterns:**

* Sprint planning sessions estimating effort for tasks that AI completes in minutes
* Daily standups tracking progress on boilerplate implementation
* Retrospectives optimizing velocity when the actual constraint is decision-making speed
* Code reviews focusing on syntax rather than system and code architecture compliance

The mismatch between tooling capabilities and process design is becoming apparent.

## Resource Allocation Analysis

#### Traditional Sprint Breakdown

* Ceremonies and coordination: 25-30%
* Boilerplate and repetitive coding: 35-40%
* Complex logic and architecture: 20-25%
* Testing and documentation: 15-20%

#### AI-Assisted Wave Breakdown

* Strategic decisions and planning: 15-20%
* AI oversight and validation: 25-30%
* Complex logic and architecture: 40-45%Testing and documentation: 5-10% (automated)

The shift in time allocation is substantial. More human effort goes toward design and validation, less toward implementation mechanics.

## Capability Distribution

#### What AI Handles Effectively

* Interface implementations from specifications
* Test generation with comprehensive coverage
* Boilerplate following established patterns
* Documentation synchronized with code
* Formatting and style consistency
* Standard error handling patterns

#### What Requires Human Involvement

* System architecture decisions
* Business logic validation
* Performance optimization strategies
* Security analysis
* Complex integration patterns
* Strategic technical choices

The division of capabilities is becoming clearer over time.

## Economic Comparison

**Traditional 5-person team ($150K FTE average):**

```
Annual cost: $750K
Features per quarter: 8-12
Technical debt: Accumulating
Test coverage: 60-70%
```

**AI-assisted 2-person team ($180K FTE average):**

```
Annual cost: $360K + tooling
Features per quarter: 15-25
Technical debt: Managed through automation
Test coverage: 90%+
```

The numbers reflect different approaches to work allocation and automation.

## Emerging Patterns

#### Teams Using AI-Assisted Development

* Continuous deployment replacing bi-weekly releases
* 90%+ test coverage as standard practice
* Senior developers focused on architecture
* Rapid response to market changes
* Reduced time on implementation details

#### Teams Using Traditional Processes

* Process overhead for human coordination
* Senior developers writing generatable code
* Manual testing and variable coverage
* Longer feedback cycles
* Significant time on repetitive work

Different approaches are producing different outcomes.

## Implementation Timeline

**Typical learning curve:**

```
Weeks 1-2: Understanding dependency-driven planning
Weeks 3-4: Adapting to wave-based execution
Weeks 5-8: Team proficiency development
Months 3-6: Process optimization and refinement
```

**Change management considerations:**

* Process adaptation during transition
* Tool integration complexity
* Quality assurance evolution
* Team workflow adjustments

The transition involves both technical and organizational elements.

## The Technical Reality

AI coding capabilities have reached a threshold where traditional development processes create artificial constraints. The tools can generate working implementations faster than humans can type them, yet most workflows still optimize for human typing speed.

**The fundamental question:** Should processes evolve to match available capabilities?

**Current state:** Most teams are using 2025 tools with 2015 processes.

**Alternative state:** Redesign processes around current AI capabilities.

The gap between these approaches is measurable in both productivity metrics and developer experience.

## Decision Framework

Organizations face three general approaches:

* **Maintain current processes** while gradually adding AI tools as assistants to existing workflows.
* **Hybrid adoption** where some AI capabilities are integrated but core processes remain unchanged.
* **Process redesign** to optimize for AI-human collaboration patterns.

Each approach produces different outcomes in terms of productivity, quality, and developer experience.

## Evidence Base

Here is how an ido4 implementation can help:

* **E-commerce platform:** 12-week authentication system completed in 3 weeks with expanded scope.
* **SaaS startup:** Team reduced from 3 developers to 1 developer + AI while increasing output.
* **Enterprise migration:** one-year project completed in 4 months with better quality metrics.

The pattern across different contexts shows similar productivity improvements and timeline compression.

## Path Forward

For teams considering this transition, the process typically involves:

1. Understanding the methodology and principles
2. Evaluating tooling options and integration requirements
3. Planning a pilot implementation
4. Gradual rollout with continuous refinement

The technical aspects are straightforward. The organizational aspects require thoughtful change management.
