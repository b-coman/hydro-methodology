# Overview

### The Scrum Problem

\--> Traditional Scrum creates artificial constraints that slow down AI-assisted development teams.

Every senior developer and product manager recognizes this pattern:

**The Traditional Scrum Reality**:

* Work forced into 2-week containers regardless of natural completion
* Product/UX work happens separately from engineering
* Discovery and design occur in silos, creating handoff friction
* Constant cycle of refinement → planning → refinement → planning
* No real value delivered during singular sprints + constant spillovers
* Developers become order-takers rather than collaborative problem-solvers
* Meeting Fatigue - process overhead dominates productive time

Traditional methodologies were designed for purely human teams, but we now work in hybrid AI-human environments where these constraints create artificial friction rather than enabling flow.

### The Hydro Solution

**The Hydro Reality**:

* Work completes when dependencies are satisfied and quality gates pass
* **Integrated Teams -** 2-3 engineers + product working as a cohesive unit
* Solutioning, design, and technical decisions running alongside implementation
* Waves cascade naturally across time based on actual completion
* Each cycle ends with reflection and methodology evolution
* Different task types optimize for AI capabilities while maintaining human expertise

**Why "Hydro"?** Like water finding the most efficient path around obstacles, Hydro enables work to flow naturally around dependencies and constraints while maintaining direction toward business objectives.

#### What You'll Learn

The following sections explain how hydro works in practice:

* **Flow Principles** - Why dependency-driven development works
* **Core Concepts** - Waves, epics, tasks, and dependencies
* **AI-Human Collaboration** - How humans and AI work together

Ready to understand the underlying principles? Let's start with why flow matters.
