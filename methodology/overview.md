# Overview

### The Scrum Problem

\--> Traditional Scrum creates artificial constraints that slow down AI-assisted development teams.

Every senior developer and product manager recognizes this pattern:

**The Traditional Scrum Reality**:

* **Rigid Time Boundaries**: Work forced into 2-week containers regardless of natural completion
* **Isolated Work Streams**: Product/UX work happens separately from engineering
* **Hidden Upstream Work**: Discovery and design occur in silos, creating handoff friction
* **Ceremony Overhead**: Constant cycle of refinement → planning → refinement → planning
* **No Real Value**: "No real value delivered during singular sprints" + "constant spillovers"
* **Engineering Bottleneck**: Developers become order-takers rather than collaborative problem-solvers
* **Meeting Fatigue**: "Too. Many. Meetings" - process overhead dominates productive time

**The Core Issue**: Traditional methodologies were designed for purely human teams, but we now work in hybrid AI-human environments where these constraints create artificial friction rather than enabling flow.

### The Hydro Solution

**The Hydro Reality**:

* **Natural Wave Boundaries**: Work completes when dependencies are satisfied and quality gates pass
* **Integrated Teams**: 2-3 engineers + product working as a cohesive unit
* **Continuous Discovery**: Solutioning, design, and technical decisions running alongside implementation
* **Flow-Based Completion**: Waves cascade naturally across time based on actual completion
* **Built-in Learning**: Each cycle ends with reflection and methodology evolution
* **AI-Human Collaboration**: Different task types optimize for AI capabilities while maintaining human expertise

**Why "Hydro"?** Like water finding the most efficient path around obstacles, Hydro enables work to flow naturally around dependencies and constraints while maintaining direction toward business objectives.
