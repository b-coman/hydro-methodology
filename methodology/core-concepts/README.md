# Core Concepts

Hydro isn't hard. Comparing with any Agile denomination, it flows more naturally. Like water.

Hydro is first and foremost a simplified Agile methodology ready to be used in a hybdrid environment. It is organized around few essential concepts:

1. core elements / or work items let's say
2. workflow
3. activities
4. tools
