# Core Concepts

Hydro isn't hard. Comparing with any Agile denomination, it flows more naturally. Like water.

Hydro is first and foremost a simplified Agile methodology ready to be used in a hybdrid environment. It is organized around few essential concepts:

1. core elements / or work items let's say
2. workflow
3. activities
4. tools

In the following section we'll describe the first three, and the 4th, Tools, will be discussed in separate section, [here](../../more/cli.md).

## Flow Principles: Why This Works

<mark style="color:red;">**NOT SURE. YET ABOUT THIS PART. IGNORE.**</mark>

Understanding the underlying principles that make Hydro effective helps teams adopt the methodology successfully and adapt it to their specific environments.

#### Dependency-Driven Flow vs Time-Boxing

**The Traditional Time-Boxing Model** creates artificial constraints that often conflict with natural work completion:

Sprint-based constraints force work into predetermined time boundaries regardless of complexity or dependencies:

* Work artificially constrained to 2-week containers regardless of natural completion points
* Velocity measured in story points per sprint rather than business capabilities delivered
* Planning ceremonies synchronized to calendar dates instead of work readiness
* Progress measured by time elapsed rather than possibilities unlocked and capabilities delivered

Problems with time-boxing become apparent in AI-assisted environments:

* AI can complete certain routine tasks in hours rather than the days assumed in sprint planning
* Complex integrations and architectural decisions don't respect arbitrary sprint boundaries
* Spillovers become the norm rather than the exception, indicating misalignment with natural work flow
* Teams optimize for sprint completion metrics rather than sustainable business value delivery

**The Hydro Flow Model** allows work to progress according to natural constraints and opportunities:

Dependency-based flow aligns execution with technical and business realities:

* Work flows naturally around technical dependencies and business constraints
* Progress measured by possibilities unlocked rather than time spent on predetermined tasks
* Completion driven by quality gates and business value delivery rather than calendar dates
* Teams optimize for sustainable value delivery and continuous capability expansion

Key principle: Work should flow like water - finding the most efficient path around obstacles while maintaining direction toward business objectives.

Flow characteristics that enable sustainable development:

* **Adaptive Duration**: Waves complete when work is genuinely finished and validated
* **Natural Boundaries**: Dependencies and quality gates define completion rather than arbitrary time limits
* **Continuous Progress**: No artificial waiting periods for sprint ceremony coordination
* **Sustainable Pace**: Teams work at optimal rhythm rather than forced sprint cadence

#### Wave Cascade Mechanics

**Natural Completion Triggers** create self-organizing workflow progression:

Waves don't end because time expires - they complete because specific, measurable criteria are satisfied:

* All internal dependencies resolved through systematic prerequisite completion
* Quality standards met through comprehensive human validation and automated testing
* Integration tests prove system stability and compatibility with existing components
* Business acceptance criteria satisfied through stakeholder validation and user testing

**Cascade Activation** enables continuous flow without artificial delays:

Wave completion triggers automatic dependency analysis that unblocks subsequent work:

* Automated identification of newly available tasks based on completed dependencies
* Priority calculation for ready tasks using unlock potential and business value metrics
* Resource allocation optimization for immediate progression to highest-value work
* Continuous workflow progression without waiting for scheduled planning ceremonies

**Emergent Duration** reflects actual work complexity rather than estimation artifacts:

Wave length emerges naturally from content complexity and dependency depth:

* Foundation waves typically complete in 1-2 days due to architectural focus and minimal dependencies
* Feature waves require 2-3 days for user-facing capability development and business logic implementation
* Integration waves span 3-5 days for system-wide coordination and end-to-end validation
* Polish waves finish in 1-2 days focused on optimization and quality enhancement

#### Epic Integrity Principle

**Business Capability Coherence** ensures meaningful value delivery:

The Epic Integrity Principle maintains the connection between technical implementation and business outcomes:

* All tasks within an epic must be assigned to the same wave to ensure capability completeness
* Epic completion occurs atomically when all constituent tasks reach validated completion
* Business capabilities are delivered as coherent units rather than fragmented implementations
* Stakeholder value is realized through complete feature sets rather than partial functionality

**Wave-Epic Alignment** creates natural business boundaries:

Epic integrity influences wave composition and ensures business value focus:

* Waves often contain complete epics, creating natural business capability boundaries
* Cross-epic waves are permitted when dependencies require specific sequencing
* Epic tasks cannot split across waves, maintaining implementation coherence
* Business planning aligns naturally with wave completion and capability delivery

This principle ensures that technical execution maintains alignment with business objectives while respecting the natural flow of dependencies and implementation requirements.
